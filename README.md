## Technologies Used

- **Frameworks and Libraries:**
  - **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static website generation. It is used for building fast, SEO-friendly web applications.
  - **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, specifically single-page applications where you can manage the view layer of the web app.
  - **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability by adding static types to the language.

- **UI and Styling:**
  - **HTML5**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
  - **SCSS (SCSS.modules)**: A preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS and allows the use of variables, nested rules, and mixins for more modular and maintainable styling.
  - **Styled-Components**: A popular library for writing CSS in JavaScript, which allows you to style components with scoped CSS using tagged template literals.
  - **Grommet Icons**: A library of SVG icons designed for the Grommet UI framework, but usable in any React application.

- **State Management:**
  - **Redux.js - Toolkit**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, particularly useful for managing the state in large-scale applications. The Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of setting up and using Redux with improved developer experience.
  - **Redux-Persist**: A library that allows you to save the Redux store in persistent storage (like local storage), so it can survive page reloads.
  - **Next-Redux-Wrapper**: A utility that allows you to use Redux in Next.js applications, handling the intricacies of server-side rendering with Redux.

- **Form Handling:**
  - **React Hook Form**: A library for managing form state in React applications. It provides a simple API to handle form validation and submission with minimal re-renders.

- **Geolocation and Mapping:**
  - **@react-google-maps/api**: A React library for integrating Google Maps into your application, enabling features like displaying maps, markers, and geolocation services.
  - **Use-Places-Autocomplete**: A custom hook for integrating Google Places Autocomplete API in your application, simplifying the implementation of location-based searches.

- **UI Components and Animation:**
  - **Swiper.js**: A modern touch slider for mobile and web, used for creating carousels and sliders within your application.

- **Utilities and Other Tools:**
  - **dotenv**: A module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, allowing you to manage sensitive configurations securely.
  - **react-cool-onclickoutside**: A React hook for detecting clicks outside a specified element, commonly used for closing dropdowns or modals when clicking outside of them.
  - **react-loader-spinner**: A library for displaying loading spinners while fetching data or during other asynchronous operations.

- **Development Tools:**
  - **npm**: The Node.js package manager, used for managing project dependencies and scripts.
  - **TypeScript**: (Also listed under frameworks) It is used not only for development but also to provide type checking and compile-time error detection.
  - **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in your JavaScript/TypeScript code. The configuration used is specifically designed for Next.js (`eslint-config-next`).
  - **Node Types**: Type definitions for Node.js modules, helping TypeScript understand Node-specific global variables and APIs.
  - **React Types**: Type definitions for React, providing intellisense and type-checking for React-specific features.
